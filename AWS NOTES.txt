EFS : Elastic File System 
--> EFS supports NFSv4.1 file system (Network File System)
--> EFS supports only Linux OS(ubuntu,federo) 
--> We need to mount to OS level directory and make an entry in fstab file for perm mount.
..> create a new security group with port number 2049


Free Tier : 5 gb EFS storage

cat /etc/mtab		--> Get entry related to EFS

vim /etc/fstab		--> Add entry there


Task : Practice EFS as we discussed.

Task 2 : Mount the EFS, while launching the ec2 instance.
